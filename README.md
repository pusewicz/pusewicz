## Hi there, I'm Piotr ðŸ‘‹

I work at [Harvest] as [Senior Software Engineer]. My spare time I nowadays
mostly spend on [GameDev], photography and tennis ðŸŽ¾.

I've been working with [Ruby] and Ruby on Rails since 2006, which is a relatively long time.

I love Ruby, but I'm currently learning low-level programming with C and exploring Swift.
